#Differentiate vs Grade

st.header('How does the level of tumor differentiation relate to its grade?')

st.markdown("""
### Think of tumor behavior as getting grades – like in school. We found:

- Well-behaved tumors mostly get '1st Grade,' less aggressive.
- 'Moderate' tumors are common in all grades.
- 'Poorly behaved' tumors often get '3rd Grade,' more aggressive.
- Some tumors are 'undecided' and can match 'anaplastic grade.'
- So, nicer-behaved tumors usually get lower grades, while others vary. This helps us understand breast cancer.
