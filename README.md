## Introduction

This dataset is designed to facilitate the analysis of cancer-related attributes and outcomes. It includes information such as age, tumor characteristics, receptor statuses, survival duration, and more.

## Dataset Columns

The dataset comprises the following columns:

1. **Age:** The age of the individual represented by the data point.
2. **Race:** The racial or ethnic background of the individual.
3. **Marital Status:** The marital status of the individual.
4. **T Stage:** The Tumor stage indicating the size and extent of the primary tumor. 
    - _In simple words, it shows how big the main tumor is and if it has spread nearby. Like measuring the boss's size and its reach. Helps understand how serious the cancer is._
5. **N Stage:** The Nodal stage indicating regional lymph node involvement. 
    - _In simple words, it iells if cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes. It's like checking if the cancer has reached nearby rest stops along its journey. The stage ranges from 0 to 3, showing how much the cancer might have spread._
7. **6th Stage:** A stage classification indicating the severity of cancer.
    - _Shows how bad the cancer is. Like a level that tells if it's not so bad or really serious. Helps doctors know how much it's grown and what to do._
9. **Differentiate:** The grade of differentiation of cancer cells.
    - _Rates how much cancer cells look normal. Like grading their appearance. Helps predict how aggressive the cancer is._
11. **Grade:** The grade of the cancer cells.
    - _Shows how abnormal the cancer cells look._
13. **A Stage:** The stage based on the extent of tumor invasion.
    -_Tells how far the cancer has spread. It's like a map showing how much it has invaded nearby areas._
14. **Tumor Size:** The size of the primary tumor.
15. **Estrogen Status:** The status of estrogen receptors in cancer cells.
16. **Progesterone Status:** The status of progesterone receptors in cancer cells.
17. **Regional Node Examined:** The number of regional lymph nodes examined.
    - _Means checking nearby lymph nodes for cancer spread_
19. **Regional Node Positive:** The number of positive lymph nodes.
20. **Survival Months:** The duration of survival after diagnosis.
21. **Status:** The status of the individual at the end of the observed period.

## Getting Started

To work with this dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using: `https://github.com/Caroline-boop/BIOINFO-PROJ.1`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BIOINFO-PROJ.1`
3. Explore the dataset and the README to understand the column meanings on the local streamlit page.

## Usage

You can use this dataset for various purposes, such as:

- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the distribution of different attributes.
- Building predictive models to predict outcomes based on the provided features.
- Gaining insights into the factors that contribute to survival duration.
