    ### Think of tumor behavior as getting grades ‚Äì like in school. We found:
    
    - Well-behaved tumors mostly get '1st Grade,' less aggressive.
    - 'Moderate' tumors are common in all grades.
    - 'Poorly behaved' tumors often get '3rd Grade,' more aggressive.
    - Some tumors are 'undecided' and can match 'anaplastic grade.'
    - So, nicer-behaved tumors usually get lower grades, while others vary. This helps us understand breast cancer.

    ### Explore the insights below, where density represents how likely or common specific cancer grades are among women of different ages:
    
    - **1st Grade at Density 0.005:** This indicates that women of various ages have a relatively low likelihood (density of 0.005) of having 1st-grade breast cancer. In simpler terms, 1st-grade breast cancer is less common among women in the dataset, regardless of their age.
    
    - **2nd Grade at Density 0.025:** Women of different ages have a moderate likelihood (density of 0.025) of having 2nd-grade breast cancer. This suggests that 2nd-grade breast cancer is more common compared to 1st grade but still not highly prevalent among women in the dataset.
    
    - **3rd Grade at Density 0.035:** Women of varying ages have a relatively higher likelihood (density of 0.035) of having 3rd-grade breast cancer. This indicates that 3rd-grade breast cancer is more common among women in the dataset compared to 1st and 2nd grades.
    
    In summary, the density in this context helps us understand how breast cancer grades are distributed among women of different ages. It shows us the likelihood of each grade occurring, with 3rd grade being the most common, followed by 2nd grade, and 1st grade being the least common in the dataset.

    - T stage is a classification system used in cancer staging to assess tumor size and invasion into nearby tissues. Higher T stages indicate larger tumors and more extensive invasion.
        ![Tumor Stages](https://almostadoctor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/stages-of-bowel-cancer.png)
    - ...In general, higher T stages often correlate with larger tumor sizes, indicating more advanced cancer. However, this correlation varies based on cancer type and other factors.
    
    - Remember, T stage and tumor size aren't the same. T stage considers more factors for a comprehensive assessment of cancer extent, while tumor size focuses solely on the primary tumor's physical size.
