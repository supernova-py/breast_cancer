#Differentiate vs Grade

st.header('1. Question: How does the level of tumor differentiation relate to its grade?üìà')

st.markdown("""
### Think of tumor behavior as getting grades ‚Äì like in school. We found:

- Well-behaved tumors mostly get '1st Grade,' less aggressive.
- 'Moderate' tumors are common in all grades.
- 'Poorly behaved' tumors often get '3rd Grade,' more aggressive.
- Some tumors are 'undecided' and can match 'anaplastic grade.'
- So, nicer-behaved tumors usually get lower grades, while others vary. This helps us understand breast cancer.

### Explore the insights below, where density represents how likely or common specific cancer grades are among women of different ages:

- **1st Grade at Density 0.005:** This indicates that women of various ages have a relatively low likelihood (density of 0.005) of having 1st-grade breast cancer. In simpler terms, 1st-grade breast cancer is less common among women in the dataset, regardless of their age.

- **2nd Grade at Density 0.025:** Women of different ages have a moderate likelihood (density of 0.025) of having 2nd-grade breast cancer. This suggests that 2nd-grade breast cancer is more common compared to 1st grade but still not highly prevalent among women in the dataset.

- **3rd Grade at Density 0.035:** Women of varying ages have a relatively higher likelihood (density of 0.035) of having 3rd-grade breast cancer. This indicates that 3rd-grade breast cancer is more common among women in the dataset compared to 1st and 2nd grades.

In summary, the density in this context helps us understand how breast cancer grades are distributed among women of different ages. It shows us the likelihood of each grade occurring, with 3rd grade being the most common, followed by 2nd grade, and 1st grade being the least common in the dataset.

st.markdown("""
- The correlation between T stage and tumor size in cancer typically reflects the extent of tumor growth or invasion into nearby tissues. üìà T stage is a classification system used to describe the primary tumor's size and extent of invasion in cancer staging, with higher T stages indicating larger tumors and more extensive invasion.

- In general, you can expect to see a positive correlation between T stage and tumor size, meaning that as the T stage increases (indicating a more advanced stage), the tumor size is likely to be larger. This is because higher T stages often correspond to larger tumors that have grown more extensively into nearby tissues or organs. üìä

    ![Tumor Stages](https://almostadoctor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/stages-of-bowel-cancer.png)

- However, it's important to note that the correlation may not be perfect, and there can be variations based on the specific type of cancer and other factors. Some cancers may have a stronger correlation between T stage and tumor size, while others may have more variability. üîÑ

- In a dataset or clinical study, you can assess the correlation between T stage and tumor size using statistical methods, such as calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. A positive correlation coefficient would indicate a positive correlation between the two variables. üìä

- Keep in mind that while T stage and tumor size are related, they are not the same thing. T stage is part of the cancer staging system and considers factors like tumor size, invasion into nearby tissues, and lymph node involvement, among others, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the extent of cancer. Tumor size, on the other hand, specifically refers to the physical size of the primary tumor. ü©∫
